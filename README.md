# MinimalSystray

The minimal code required for a nice Windows systray icon with a popup menu.

The systray managing code runs in its own thread so it can be nicely integrated with code that just runs in a console application (perfect for server applications).

This project also comes with a minimal icon file, resource file and Visual Studio project (which opens and builds in 2012, 2013 and 2015 with no modifications).
